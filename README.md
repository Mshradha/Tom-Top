My First Project :Construct Week Project At Masai School “Tomtop- Love, Shopping, Sharing”

Before I start my blog writing on the clone of the website, I want to thank Masai School for this great opportunity and for providing this great platform to enhance my coding and life skills.
I have tried my level best to make use of my so far journey and the knowledge that I have gained so far at Masai School to come up with my first Individual project.

Getting Started…
It was a challenging task for me as I had to complete it within the time of construct week, so I faced different challenges like it was my first individual project . So I started with planning and studying the website, then I distributed the workflow, in number of days and with dedication , I managed the work.

Project Details -
I had to make a replica of the TOMTOP
TomTop is N.V. is a Dutch multinational developer and creator of location technology and consumer electronics. Founded in 1991 and headquartered in Amsterdam, TomTop released its first generation of satellite navigation devices to market in 2004.
I have tried my best to clone the replica of the website.
